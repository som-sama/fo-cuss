In Version 1, the web app offers a fully functional 25-minute pomodoro timer with a reset button and a 5-minute break button. It comes with a visually appealing design, featuring background and hover effects for a pleasant user experience.

### Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

## Version 2

In Version 2, we plan to enhance the functionality and user experience significantly. Here are the planned features and improvements:

- **User Authentication**: Implement a user authentication system to allow users to create accounts and track their progress over time.

- **Focus Points and Reward System**: Introduce a system to accumulate focus points and reward users for consistent usage and productivity.

- **50-minute Timer and 10-minute Break**: Add a longer 50-minute timer for tasks that require more extended periods of focus, followed by a 10-minute break.

- **Website Blocker**: Incorporate a website blocker feature to help users avoid distractions during work sessions.

- **Settings Page and User Profile Page**: Create dedicated pages for users to customize app settings and view their progress and achievements.

- **Database Integration**: Set up a database to store user data, settings, and progress, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

- **Framework Migration**: Shift from plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript to modern frameworks such as React for improved maintainability and scalability, along with Tailwind CSS for faster and more efficient styling.

### Tech Stack

- Firebase
- Tailwind CSS

## Current Progress

As of now, we are in the planning phase for incorporating AWS (Amazon Web Services) into the project. We believe that AWS will offer us robust infrastructure and scalability options to support the growing user base and ensure a seamless experience.

Additionally, we are actively working on implementing the Firebase user authentication system. While progress has been made, the authentication system is not yet complete. We are dedicated to ensuring the highest level of security and user privacy, and the Firebase authentication will play a crucial role in achieving that.

## Next Steps

We are actively working on the following features and improvements:

- **Website Blocker**: Implement the website blocker feature to assist users in staying focused by blocking distracting websites during work sessions.

- **Settings Page and User Profile Page**: Develop dedicated pages to enable users to personalize their experience and view their productivity insights.
