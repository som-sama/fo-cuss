# foCuss

## We know focus but what's foCuss?
foCuss is a web based(currently) pomodoro timer which is focused to be anime themed and more fun than the usual pomodoro timers. 

## How it works?
- After clicking the Fo-cussing button a timer of 25 mins starts with a 'gambare' meaning goodluck in the anime world. Try it out yourself.
- The Re-cussing button resets the timer which is mostly considered as a failure and someone calls you a 'baka'. Try it out yourself.
- The Break from Cussing button is a 5 mins break timer. Once it ends you know its time to cuss again.
-  Currently in the version 1 we have only one theme and the lofi girls. Stay tuned because its gonna be cool in the future.
